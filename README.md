![project logo](./.github/logo.png)

This project provides a way to use [Azure Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-bus/) as a [WebRTC Signaling](https://www.onsip.com/voip-resources/voip-fundamentals/webrtc-signaling) provider from any typescript application. However please note that this isn't a full featured implementation, it's just a proof of concept. Included here is a set of examples, and a core class [`symmetric-bus`](./src/lib/symmetric-bus.ts) that provides the connectivity. The expected use of this repository is to understand how one might use such a class to provide connectivity, how it scales, and how it works.
